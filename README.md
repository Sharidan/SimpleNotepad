# SimpleNotepad
A simple notepad written in C# for WinForms

# Live Stream Project
This project is the result of a live C# tutorial stream I did on Twitch.

Streamed and published 30. March 2018

SimpleNotepad was meant as a tutorial project to show-case a way of creating an application similar to the standard Notepad that comes with Windows.
The stream and code shows simple ways of accomplishing basic tasks such as loading and saving files, how to build functionality into control events, how to handle possible errors and how to interact between forms.

The entire 5 hours, 22 minutes of the stream is available on YouTube:
